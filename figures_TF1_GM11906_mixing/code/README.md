# Code for analyzing TF1/MERRF mixing experiments

- Scripts 01-09 are used to analyze and benchmark modifications to the original 10x scATAC-seq protocol, including complexity
- Scripts 11-19 are used to analyze variation in the GM11906 (MERRF) cell line w.r.t. the abundance of pathogenic heteroplasmy
- Scripts 21-23 identify subclonal variation in the known polyclonal TF1 cell line
